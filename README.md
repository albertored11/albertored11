## `$ whoami`

I am Alberto Redondo, aka Herbort, a 26-year-old computer enthusiast.

Ever since I was a kid, I've always been interested in technology, especially in computers, and I used to spend hours in front of my PC, tinkering with anything that caught my attention. I didn't achieve big things (I didn't even learn a single programming language), but I've always been interested in learning more and more, and people around me said computers were my thing and now I think they were right.

Since then, my curiosity has only become bigger, and I constantly keep tinkering with my computer and learning new things. In 2017, I started my Computer Science Engineering studies at UCM, and I have learned a lot of things about different fields: programming paradigms and languages, computers, maths, databases, algorithms, data structures, operating systems, computer networks, AI...

I am a very curious person, and I am constantly looking forward to learn anything I can. I love to discover new things, to explore alternatives, and to think about different ways to get the same result.
